## Example Shiny apps

This repository was set up to illustrate accessibility features in Shiny apps. To run each app, clone the repo to your computer. Then in R, run the relevant "app.R" file.

* The *WCAG with penguins* app illustrates several WCAG requirements related to font, color, and keyboard navigation. See the folder's readme for the full list of WCAG requirements it illustrates.

* The *texture and sound* app illustrates some R packages that can help improve accessibility for blind users.

* The *walkthrough* folder contains examples to make a basic app more accessible for keyboard and screen readers by improving alternate and aria text and by adding instructions.

* The *presentation scripts* folder contains scripts and slides for presentations we have given on dashboard accessibility.
